WASH AWAY THE ANGER

Here I stand beneath
The warm and soothing rain
The droplets falling
Gently down on the terrain
Wash away the sorrow
All the stains of time
But there's no memory
It's only dry inside

In the mud and sinking deeper
Into a peaceful life

AND IT WILL COME
LIKE A FLOOD OF PAIN
POURING DOWN ON ME
And it will not let up
Until the end is here
AND IT WILL COME
THROUGH THE DARKEST DAY
IN MY FINAL HOUR
And it will never rest
Until the clouds are clear

Until it finds my dreams have DIISAAPPEEEEEAAREED
